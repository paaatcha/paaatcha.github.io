### A brief academic history

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo  (UFES - Vit√≥ria, Brazil) in 2020. My [thesis](https://informatica.ufes.br/en/pos-graduacao/PPGI/thesis-details?id=14992) was developed under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Renato A. Krohling](http://inf.ufes.br/~rkrohling). During my Ph.D., I spent almost a year as a visiting graduate research student at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Thomas Trappenberg](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/thomas-trappenberg.html) and also worked with [Prof. Dr. Sageev Oore](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/sageev-oore.html). 

During my Ph.D., I mainly worked on algorithms to combine images and metadata for different medical image problems, in particular, skin lesion detection. From 2017 to 2020, I led a [non-profit project](/projects/skin_cancer_diagnosis/) in Brazil that developed an application to assist in skin cancer detection using images collected from smartphones and patient clinical information. This work resulted in many papers, which you can find in my [list of publications](/research/#list-of-publications). Also, you may donwload [my Ph.D. thesis here](https://informatica.ufes.br/en/pos-graduacao/PPGI/thesis-details?id=14992).


Prior to my Ph.D., I got my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science¬†also at UFES. During this time, I worked with methodologies to combine an ensemble of classifiers. You may download [my M.Sc. dissertation here](http://repositorio.ufes.br/handle/10/6811). Also at UFES, I took my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineer (the undergraduate system in Brazil is different; we don‚Äôt have majors or minors). During this time, I got involved in different projects, which you may check in my [undergraduate portfolio](/assets/files/andre-pacheco-eng-undergrad-portfolio.pdf). The most exciting project was the university robotic team. My colleagues and I founded [ERUS (the UFES robotic team)](https://erus.ufes.br/) and we have won some robotic competition promoted by IEEE. You may see them in my [awards and prizes list](/awards).

### Volunteer work

In general, I love to learn about different tech tools and concepts (but not only in my field, I love to learn about history, for example). I think these are my main characteristics as a professional and a human being: learning, creating, and sharing. I really like to apply my knowledge to tackle real-life problems. So, besides my research and professional work, I got engaged in different volunteer works that aim to improve peoples' lives. In the following, I describe the main projects I've been working on:


+ **Orienta Covid ES HUCAM UFES** (2020): this is a project created by professors/doctors from the university hospital of UFES (HUCAM) that provides orientation about COVID-19 to people in general. I act as a volunteer by providing IT support and developing a web server (Java/SpringBoot, Angular, MySQL, and AWS) to help doctors to store data from the appointments.

+ **PAD-UFES** (2017-2020): I led a team that developed a web-based system (using Spring-Boot, Angular, and MySQL) and a smartphone application (using React-Native) to track the moles and spots on patients‚Äô skin. By using this system, the doctors are able to provide better assistance care to the people. Currently, the team maintains this software for the program and provides IT support¬†in general. Right now, we open-sourced the web server, and you can find it [here](https://github.com/labcin-ufes/PAD-UFES-20/tree/master/software).

+ **Kanguru Project** (2016): I was a volunteer at¬†Kangaroo, a UFES project that provides assistance to pregnant teenagers in the Esp√≠rito Santo state. This is a major health issue in Brazil and I worked as a Data Scientist to help researchers from this project understand the data that¬†they collect from their patients.

+ **PASUFES** (2012-2013): I helped to found a preparatory course to assist low-income people in achieving good scores in Vestibular. In Brazil, to get a spot in a¬†(public) university, we need to take an exam called vestibular. All university spots are filled according to the vestibular score. I taught physics in this project (high school level) and some of my students got a high scores on the exam. Sometimes, I see some of them in the university aisles and it‚Äôs very satisfying.

### Computa√ß√£o inteligente
[Computa√ß√£o inteligente](http://computacaointeligente.com.br) is my ~~amazing~~ humble blog. 
I write in Brazilian-Portuguese about my topics of interest at an easily understandable¬†level.¬†My main goal with this blog is to help students understand the algorithms concepts. But why don‚Äôt write in English? Well, many people in Brazil don‚Äôt speak English or don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the language. So, I‚Äôd like to help them. Also, all my undergraduate and graduate studies were done for free in a public university. This is a way to return to my community the investment that was done on me.
