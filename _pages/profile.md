#### A brief academic history

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo](http://ufes.br) (Vit√≥ria, Brazil) in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Renato A. Krohling](http://inf.ufes.br/~rkrohling). During my studies, I spent almost a year as a visiting graduate research student at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/) (Halifax, Canada), working with [Prof. Dr. Thomas Trappenberg](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/thomas-trappenberg.html and [Prof. Dr. Sageev Oore](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/sageev-oore.html).

My Ph.D. research focused on developing algorithms to combine images and metadata for various medical image problems, particularly skin lesion detection. During this time, I led a [non-profit project](/projects/skin_cancer_diagnosis/) in Brazil from 2017 to 2020, which developed an application to assist in skin cancer detection using images from smartphones and patient clinical information. This work resulted in multiple publications, which you can find in my [list of publications](/research/#list-of-publications). Additionally, you may download my [Ph.D. thesis here](https://informatica.ufes.br/en/pos-graduacao/PPGI/thesis-details?id=14992).

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at UFES, where I worked on methodologies for combining an ensemble of classifiers. You can also [download my M.Sc. dissertation](http://repositorio.ufes.br/handle/10/6811) from the university's repository. Furthermore, during my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at UFES, I worked on various projects that you can find in my [undergraduate portfolio](/assets/files/andre-pacheco-eng-undergrad-portfolio.pdf). One of the most exciting projects was founding the [UFES robotic team](https://erus.ufes.br/dev), ERUS, with my colleagues, and winning some robotics competitions promoted by IEEE, which you can find in my [list of awards and prizes](/awards).

## Volunteer work

 In addition to my research and professional pursuits, I am involved in multiple volunteer projects that aim to improve people's lives. Below are the main projects I have been working on:


+ **PAD-UFES** (2017-2020, 2022-now): I have led a team that developed and currently maintains a web-based system and smartphone application called PAD-UFES (2017-2020, 2022-now). The system, built with Spring-Boot, Angular, and MySQL, allows doctors to track moles and spots on patients' skin, leading to better care. Our team provides ongoing IT support for the program, and you can learn more about it by [clicking here](/projects/skin_cancer_diagnosis).

+ **Orienta Covid ES HUCAM UFES** (2020): this project was created by professors and doctors from the [University Hospital of UFES (HUCAM)](https://www.ufes.br/hospital-universit%C3%A1rio-cassiano-antonio-moraes-hucam) to provide guidance on COVID-19 to the general public. I volunteered by providing IT support and developing a web server using Java/SpringBoot, Angular, MySQL, and AWS, which helped doctors store data from their appointments.

+ **Kanguru Project** (2016): As a volunteer at Kangaroo, a UFES project that supports pregnant teenagers in the Esp√≠rito Santo state, I worked as a data scientist to help researchers analyze the data they collect from their patients. This is a significant health issue in Brazil, and I was happy to contribute my skills to help make a difference.

+ **PASUFES** (2012-2013): I helped to found a preparatory course to assist low-income people in achieving good scores in Vestibular. In Brazil, to get a spot in a¬†(public and free) university, we need to take an exam called vestibular. All university spots are filled according to the vestibular score. I taught physics in this project (high school level) and some of my students got a high scores on the exam. Sometimes, I see some of them in the university aisles and it‚Äôs very satisfying. 


## Computa√ß√£o inteligente
[Computa√ß√£o inteligente](http://computacaointeligente.com.br) is my ~~amazing~~ humble blog. 
I write in Brazilian-Portuguese about my topics of interest at an easily understandable¬†level.¬†My main goal with this blog is to help students understand the algorithms concepts. But why don‚Äôt write in English? Well, many people in Brazil don‚Äôt speak English or don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the language. So, I‚Äôd like to help them. Also, all my undergraduate and graduate studies were done for free in a public university. This is a way to return to my community the investment that was done on me.
