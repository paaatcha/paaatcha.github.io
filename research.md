Currently, I’m a member of the Bio-Inspired Computer Lab. ( Laboratório de Computação Inspirado na Natureza, LABCIN). The lab works with different fields of computational intelligence, such as machine learning, deep learning, evolutionary computation, fuzzy systems and decision-making. The lab is led by Prof. Renato A. Krohling and is composed by around 20 people.
