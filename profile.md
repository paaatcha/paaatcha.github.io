I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Espírito Santo  (UFES - Vitória, Brazil) in 2020. My thesis was developed under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Renato A. Krohling](http://inf.ufes.br/~rkrohling). During my Ph.D., I spent almost a year as a visiting graduate research student at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Thomas Trappenberg](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/thomas-trappenberg.html) and worked with [Prof. Dr. Sageev Oore](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/sageev-oore.html). In my Ph.D., I worked with algorithms to detect skin cancer. From 2017 to 2020, I led a non-profit (you may find more information about this project [here](http://pachecoandre.com.br/pages/projects/skin_cancer_diagnosis)0 project in Brazil that developed an application to assist in skin cancer detection using images collected from smartphones and patient clinical information. This work resulted in many papers in which you can find in [list of publications](research). In my Ph.D. thesis, I developed an algorithm to combine skin cancer images and patient demographics. You can download and read my thesis [here]().


Prior to my Ph.D., I got my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science also at UFES. During this time, I worked with methodologies to combine an ensemble of classifiers. Also at UFES, I took my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineer (the undergraduate system in Brazil is different; we don’t have majors or minors). During this time, I got involved in different projects, and the most exciting one was the university robotic team. My colleagues and I founded ERUS (the UFES robotic team) and we have won some robotic competition promoted by IEEE. You may see my awards and prizes [here](http://pachecoandre.com.br/research.html#awards).  

My current research focus is on Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision in particular for healthcare. Nonetheless, I also have an interest in Data Science, Natural Computing, and Decision Making. Currently, **I’m an AI Researcher at Samsung R&D Institute Brazil.**



In general, I love to learn about different tech tools and concepts (but not only in my field, I love to learn about history, for example). I think these are my main characteristics as a professional and a human being: learning, creating, and sharing. I really like to apply my knowledge to tackle real-life problems. So, besides my research and professional work, I got engaged in different volunteer works that aim to improve peoples' lives.

## Volunteer work

I've been engaged in volunteer work since 2012. In the following, I describe the main projects I've been working on:

+ **PASUFES (2012-2013)**: I helped to found a preparatory course to assist low-income people to achieve good scores in Vestibular. In Brazil, to get a spot in a (public) university, we need to take an exam called vestibular. All universities spots are filled according to the vestibular score. I taught physics in this project (high school level) and some of my students were able to get a high score on the exam. Sometimes, I see some of them in the university aisles and it’s very satisfying. 

+ **Kanguru Project (2016)**: I was a volunteer at Kangaroo, a UFES project that provides assistant to pregnant teenagers in the Espírito Santo state. This is a major health issue in Brazil and I worked as data scientist to help researchers from this project understand the data that they collect from their patients.

+ **PAD-UFES (2017-2020)**: I led a team that developed a web-based system (using Spring-Boot, Angular, and MySQL) and a smartphone application (using React-Native) to track the moles and spots on patients’ skin. By using this system, the doctors are able to provide a better assistance care to the people. Currently, the team maintains this software for the program and provides IT support in general. Right now, we open-sourced the web-server, and you can find it [here](https://github.com/labcin-ufes/PAD-UFES-20/tree/master/software).

+ **Orienta Covid ES HUCAM UFES**: this is a project created by professors/doctors from the university hospital of UFES (HUCAM) that provides orientation about COVID-19 to people in general. I act as a volunteer by providing IT support and developing a web server (Java/SpringBoot, Angular, MySQL, and AWS) to help doctors to store data from the appointments.

## Skills
+ Python, PyTorch, Scit-Learn, Tensorflow, Java, SpringBoot, MATLAB, Angular, HTML, CSS and Latex
+ Arduino and raspberry-pi

## Computação inteligente
[Computação inteligente](http://computacaointeligente.com.br) is my ~~amazing~~ humble blog. 
I write in Brazilian-Portuguese about my topics of interest at an easily understandable level. My main goal with this blog is to help undergraduate students understand the algorithms concepts. But why don’t write in English? Well, many people in Brazil don’t speak English or don’t feel comfortable with the language. So, I’d like to help them. In addition, there are very nice blogs doing the same thing in English. My blog is just an alternative source.
