I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES – Vitória, ES, Brazil), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Renato A. Krohling](http://inf.ufes.br/~rkrohling). I also spent ~9 months in Canada as a visiting graduate research student at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Thomas Trappenberg](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/thomas-trappenberg.html). Currently, my research focus is on machine/deep learning and computer vision, in particular for healthcare. I am leading a [non-profit](http://pachecoandre.com.br/pages/projects/skin_cancer_diagnosis) project in Brazil that aims to diagnose skin cancer using images collected from smartphones and patient demographics. In addition, I also have an interest in data analysis, natural computing and decision making.

Prior to my Ph.D., I got my M.Sc degree in Computer Science also at UFES. During this time, I worked with methodologies to combine an ensemble of classifiers. Also at UFES, I took my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineer (the undergraduate system in Brazil is different; we don’t have majors or minors). During this time, I got involved in different projects, and the most exciting one was the university robotic team. My colleagues and I founded ERUS (the UFES robotic team) and we have won some robotic competition promoted by IEEE. You may see my awards and prizes [here](http://pachecoandre.com.br/research.html#awards).

## Volunteer work
I’m also engaged with volunteer work. In 2012, I helped to found a preparatory course to assist low-income people to achieve good scores in Vestibular. In Brazil, to get a spot in a university, we need to take an exam called vestibular. All universities spots are filled according to the vestibular score. I taught physics in this project (high school level) and some of my students were able to get a high score on the exam. Sometimes, I see some of them in the university aisles and it’s very satisfying. I was also a volunteer at Kangaroo, a UFES project that provides assistant to pregnant teenagers in the Espírito Santo state. This is a major health issue in Brazil and I worked as data analyst to help researchers from this project understand the data that they collect from their patients.

Currently, I’m leading a team that developed a web-based system (using Spring-Boot and Angular) and a smartphone application (using React-Native) to track the moles and spots on the patients’ skin. By using this system, the doctors are able to provide a better assistance care to the people. Currently, the team maintains this software for the program and provides IT support in general.

## Computação inteligente
[Computação inteligente](http://computacaointeligente.com.br) is my ~~amazing~~ humble blog. 
I write in Brazilian-Portuguese about my topics of interest at an easily understandable level. My main goal with this blog is to help undergraduate students understand the algorithms concepts. But why don’t write in English? Well, many people in Brazil don’t speak English or don’t feel comfortable with the language. So, I’d like to help them. In addition, there are very nice blogs doing the same thing in English. My blog is just an alternative source.
