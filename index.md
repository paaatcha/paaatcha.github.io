Hi! Welcome to my personal page. 
Here you‚Äôre going to find some information about my academic work as well as other topics that I have the interest.

For more information about my work, my topics of interest and my research group, go to [Profile](profile). You also can find my list of works/publications and teaching materials in [Research](research) and [Teaching](Teaching), respectively. To check my awards and prizes, go to [Awards](awards).

In my [blog](blog) area, I share some thoughts, some tutorials for my students, among other kinds of stuff. Most of the time I‚Äôm going to write in Portuguese because almost always my audience will be Brazilians.

In addition, I have another blog called [Computa√ß√£o Inteligente](http://computacaointeligente.com.br) in which I provide, in Brazilian Portuguese, some machine learning algorithms tutorials, algorithms codes, among others stuffs. In fact, some people ask me, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you write in English in your blog?‚Äù Well, there are plenty of machine learning blogs in English, and my goal is to provide similar content to undergraduate students in Brazil that don‚Äôt feel confident enough to learn it in English. That‚Äôs the reason.
