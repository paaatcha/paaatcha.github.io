Hi, welcome to my personal page.

In my [blog](blog) area, I share some thoughts, some tutorials for my students, among others kinds of stuff. Most of the time I’m gonna be writing in Portuguese because almost always my audience is this blog is gonna be Brazilians.

In addition, I have another blog called [Computação Inteligente](http://computacaointeligente.com.br) in which I provide, in Brazilian Portuguese, some machine learning algorithms tutorials, algorithms codes, among others stuffs. In fact, some people ask me “why don’t you write in English in your blog?” Well, there are a plenty of machine learning blogs in English, and my goal is to provide a similar content to undergraduate students in Brazil that don’t feel confident enough to learn in English. That’s the reason.
