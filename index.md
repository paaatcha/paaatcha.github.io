`Hello world!` 

Welcome to my personal webpage. 
Here you’re going to find some information about my professional career as well as other topics that I have the interest.

For more information about my work, my topics of interest and my research group, go to [Profile](profile). You also can find my list of works/publications and teaching materials in [Research](research) and [Teaching](Teaching), respectively. To check my awards and prizes, go to [Awards](awards).

In my [blog](blog) area, I share some thoughts, some tutorials for my former students, among other related things. Most of the time I’m going to write in Portuguese because most of my audience will be Brazilians.
